# NyarlathotIA Mount Exclusions Configuration
# Project-specific patterns to exclude from Docker mounts
#
# Patterns support glob syntax: * ? []
# Paths are relative to project root
#
# Examples:
# .env.local              # Exclude specific file
# secrets/                # Exclude entire directory
# *.backup                # Exclude by extension
# internal-docs/**/*.md   # Exclude nested files

#
# Note: Global security patterns are always applied first
# This file adds additional project-specific exclusions
